# SunsetWebinterfaceMiddleware

#### Creator: Markus Ropatsch

This is the repository for the project **Sunset Webinterface Middleware**.

##### IMPORTANT: for executing *.jar file (generated by Spring Boot) via command line: `keystore.jks` AND `sunset.jar` must be copied to the same folder from where the *.jar file is executed

Certain features of the Java-Code are not implemented yet but might get added later.

**UPDATE [2019-04-04]:** You can now also execute the program via the commandline using the `jar`-File generated by Spring Boot! (Executing the program via Spring Boot inside of Eclipse worked without any issues)
> ~~**UPDATE [2019-04.03]**: executing the program in command line via the `*.jar`-File generated by Spring Boot causes the following error when trying to execute code via the webinterface: `There was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500). Error resolving template "/index", template might not exist or might not be accessible by any of the configured Template Resolvers.`~~

This project features the already existing webinterface created by **Peter Pfaffeneder** with some modifications.
> ~~The Web Interface in this version only contains the bare minimum of context (no CSS, minimal Javascript) to be able to use its features.~~

The source code for **Sunset** can be found here: [Sunset Github](https://github.com/stefan-rass/sunset-ffapl)
