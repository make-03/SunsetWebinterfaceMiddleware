# SunsetWebinterfaceMiddleware-PROTOTYPE

#### Creator: Markus Ropatsch

#### Supervisor: Stefan Rass

---

This is the private repository for the project **Sunset Webinterface Middleware**.

##### IMPORTANT: this repository is set to private until the project is finished!

##### IMPORTANT: for executing *.jar file (generated by Spring Boot) via command line: `keystore.jks` AND `sunset.jar` must be copied to the same folder from where the *.jar file is executed

Certain features of the Java-Code are not implemented yet but might get added later.

> **UPDATE [03.04.2019]**: executing the program in command line via the `*.jar`-File generated by Spring Boot causes the following error when trying to execute code via the webinterface: `There was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500). Error resolving template "/index", template might not exist or might not be accessible by any of the configured Template Resolvers.`
(Executing the program via Spring Boot inside of Eclipse works without any issues)

This project features the already existing webinterface created by **Peter Pfaffeneder** with some modifications.
> ~~The Web Interface in this version only contains the bare minimum of context (no CSS, minimal Javascript) to be able to use its features.~~

The source code for **Sunset** can be found here: [Sunset Github](https://github.com/stefan-rass/sunset-ffapl)

> The following list of features is **not final** and certain things may change in the future (finished AND unfinished ones)!

## List of changes + working features:
* [25-03-2019] created maven-project in eclipse + add dependencies: spring, spring-boot 
* [25-03-2019] created basic structure for program (`src/main/java`, `src/main/resources`, `src/test/java`)
* [25-03-2019] created basic webinterface + javascript
* [26-03-2019] created basic controller class for implementing HTTP-Methods (GET, POST etc.)
* [26-03-2019] sending data (code for **sunset**) from webinterface (browser) to java-program (webserver)
* [26-03-2019] communication with server only via port 443 (SSL enabled!) using privately signed certificate for testing (EXPERIMENTAL)
* [27-03-2019] executing sunset (via commandline) using java + passing code from website
* [27-03-2019] reading sunset output from commandline and sending it to the webinterface (only plain text for now)
* [27-03-2019] parallel execution of several independent user requests already possible (data for each user created locally inside specific controller class, so each user has its own private data stored in memory)
* [27-03-2019] manually cancelling execution of sunset possible (via button on website ONLY while code is executing) **BUT** currently terminates the main `java.exe` process which also terminates all other concurrent sunset executions AND the executable **jar**-file created by Spring-Boot if it is running via the command line
* [02-04-2019] updated the minimal webinterface to the already existing one created by **Peter Pfaffeneder** with some modifications + added all the static web content under `/resources/static`
* [02-04-2019] changed name of java packages for better readability + updated `pom.xml`
* [03-04-2019] resolved errors for code examples inside `ffapl_api.js`, changed **single quotes** to **double quotes** inside `print(ln)` statements
* [03-04-2019] included template engine **thymeleaf** (added to `pom.xml`) and updated controller class to show results of the sunset execution in the correct element of the webinterface (`outputTextArea`)
    * controller methods now return `ModelandView` instead of just `String` (plain text)
* [03-04-2019] renamed `/resources/public` to `/resources/templates` to make **thymeleaf** work properly when calling cotroller-methods
* [03-04-2019] modified `index.html` and `sunset-max-stylesheet.css` to better show the `outputTextField` and added code for **thymeleaf**
* [03-04-2019] implemented the **save** function in the `sunset-max-frontend-functions.js`-file for the webinterface (save button) -> you can now download code from the input console as a `*.ffapl`-file and load these files via the **load** button

## List of features to implement/create in the future:
* create logger class and store logging info (in local **log** files); create 2 seperate logging files for different content: **info.log** and **error.log**
* edit existing `sunset webinterface`
     * change/remove unused functions or scripts
          * e.g. program code for PHP (not used in this version!)
     * add basic console logging in java script
     * change/remove/restructure elements (e.g. buttons or sidebar elements)
     * javascript-functions `undo()` and `redo()` currently do not work properly (using CodeMirror)
* resolve problem with dispatcher-servlet when executing via the commandline (see: **UPDATE [03.04.2019]**)
* implement solution for manually cancelling only the corresponding sunset process for a specific user instead of terminating all java processes
* research `Docker` and its basic functionalities
* deploy generated .jar file + keystore + sunset.jar in docker-container and run it
