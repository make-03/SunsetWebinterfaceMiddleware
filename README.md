# SunsetWebinterfaceMiddleware-PROTOTYPE

#### Creator: Markus Ropatsch

#### Supervisor: Stefan Rass

---

This is the repository for the project **Sunset Webinterface Middleware**.

##### IMPORTANT: for executing *.jar file (generated by Spring Boot) via command line: `keystore.jks` AND `sunset.jar` must be copied to the same folder from where the *.jar file is executed

Certain features of the Java-Code are not implemented yet but might get added later.

**UPDATE [04.04.2019]** You can now also execute the program via the commandline using the `jar`-File generated by Spring Boot! (Executing the program via Spring Boot inside of Eclipse worked without any issues)
> ~~**UPDATE [03.04.2019]**: executing the program in command line via the `*.jar`-File generated by Spring Boot causes the following error when trying to execute code via the webinterface: `There was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500). Error resolving template "/index", template might not exist or might not be accessible by any of the configured Template Resolvers.`~~

This project features the already existing webinterface created by **Peter Pfaffeneder** with some modifications.
> ~~The Web Interface in this version only contains the bare minimum of context (no CSS, minimal Javascript) to be able to use its features.~~

The source code for **Sunset** can be found here: [Sunset Github](https://github.com/stefan-rass/sunset-ffapl)

## List of features to implement/create in the future:

* improve code structure and add more methods for better structure
* edit existing `sunset webinterface`

     * add basic console logging in java script
     * change/remove/restructure elements (e.g. buttons or sidebar elements like code snippets)
* improve formating when printing code via the web interface and maybe include syntax highlighting
* stopping of the spring boot app (which method would make sense?)


* **potential future tasks, currently not needed**     
     * research `Docker` and its basic functionalities
     * deploy generated .jar file + keystore + sunset.jar in docker-container and run it
