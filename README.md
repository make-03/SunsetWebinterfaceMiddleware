# SunsetWebinterface-PROTOTYPE

#### Creator: Markus Ropatsch

#### Supervisor: Stefan Rass

---

This is the private repository for testing the basic functionalities for the project **Sunset Webinterface Middleware**.

##### IMPORTANT: this is not the final code that will be submitted together with the documentation at the end for grading the bachelor thesis!

##### IMPORTANT: for executing *.jar file (generated by Spring Boot) via command line: `keystore.jks` AND `sunset.jar` must be copied to the same folder from where the *.jar file is executed

The Web Interface in this version only contains the bare minimum of context (no CSS, minimal Javascript) to be able to use its features.

Certain features of the Java-Code are also not implemented yet but might get added later.

The source code for **Sunset** can be found here: [Sunset Github](https://github.com/stefan-rass/sunset-ffapl)

#### main programming language: `Java 8`
#### IDE used: `Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers Version 2018-09 (4.9.0)`
#### Build-Management-Tool used: `Maven`
#### Frameworks used: `Spring`, `Spring-Boot`

> The following list of features is **not final** and certain things may change in the future (finished AND unfinished ones)!

## List of working features:
* [25-03-2019] create maven-project in eclipse + add dependencies: spring, spring-boot 
* [25-03-2019] create basic structure for program (`src/main/java`, `src/main/resources`, `src/test/java`)
* [25-03-2019] create basic webinterface + javascript
* [26-03-2019] create basic controller class for implementing HTTP-Methods (GET, POST etc.)
* [26-03-2019] sending data (code for **sunset**) from webinterface (browser) to java-program (webserver)
* [26-03-2019] communication with server only via port 443 (SSL enabled!) using privately signed certificate for testing (EXPERIMENTAL)
* [27-03-2019] executing sunset (via commandline) using java + passing code
* [27-03-2019] reading sunset output from commandline and sending it to the webinterface (only plain text for now)
* [27-03-2019] parallel execution of several independent user requests already possible (data for each user created locally inside specific controller class, so each user has its own private data stored in memory)
* [27-03-2019] manually cancelling execution of sunset possible (via button on website ONLY while code is executing) **BUT** currently terminates the main `java.exe` process which also terminates all other concurrent sunset executions AND the executable **jar**-file created by Spring-Boot if it is running via the command line

## List of features to implement/create in the future:
* create logger class and store logging info (in local **log** files); create 2 seperate logging files for different content: **info.log** and **error.log**
* return result from sunset execution as a **html**-page for the user
* implement solution for manually cancelling only the corresponding sunset process for specific user instead of terminating all java processes
* research docker and its basic functionalities
* deploy generated .jar file + keystore + sunset.jar in docker-container and run it
