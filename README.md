This is the repository for the project **Sunset Webinterface Middleware**.

This project features the already existing webinterface created by **Peter Pfaffeneder** with some modifications.

The source code for **Sunset** can be found here: [Sunset Github](https://github.com/stefan-rass/sunset-ffapl)

Software needed to generate the *.jar file generated by Spring Boot: 
**TODO!**

##### [IMPORTANT] For executing the generated Spring Boot ***.jar file via command line: `keystore.jks`, `sunset.jar` and `threadpoolconfig.properties` must be copied to the same folder from where the *.jar file is executed!

When starting the Webserver use the following command via the command line or Power Shell (Power Shell is preferred) when you are in the same folder as the generated Spring Boot *.jar file:<br/> `java -jar <NAME_OF_SUNSET_APPLICATION>.jar`<br/>
This command should start the Spring Boot Application and make the Webinterface accessible by typing the following URL in a modern browser:<br/>`https://localhost` (when running it locally).

Once the Server is running there will be new files generated; the first one contains the PID of the Spring Boot Application running (name of this process is "Java" under Windows) and is stored in `./bin/shutdown.pid`. The second one is a log file which contains useful information about the lifecycle of the server and the events happening. It is stored in `./logs/sunsetLog.log`.

There are also arguments that the user can pass (from another opened Power Shell / Command Line). For this you also need to be in the folder that contains the *.jar file generated by Spring Boot. There are currently 2 arguments that can be passed:<br/>

* `java -jar <NAME_OF_SUNSET_APPLICATION>.jar --shutdown` The **shutdown** argument shuts down an already running Application of Spring Boot.


* `java -jar <NAME_OF_SUNSET_APPLICATION>.jar --restart` The **restart** argument does the same thing as shutdown during the first step and then starts a new Application of Spring Boot. This is useful if there were changes to some external configuration (like properties file for ThreadPool or logging) without having to Run a Maven Build again.

If the user enters an invalid argument or too many an exception is thrown and nothing happens.
