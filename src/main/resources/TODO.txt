DONE:
- added class "SunsetThreadPool"
	- manages all the threads + execution of sunset
	- hash-map to store key-value pairs to identify which user (user-id) is associated with which thread-id currently running
		- used because users can manually cancel calculations
		
TODO:
- change/remove "SunsetExecutor" class! (or move part of the code to "SunsetThreadPool")
- add code for thread lifecycle 
	- execution of code via sunset
	- implementing timeout + manual cancelling
